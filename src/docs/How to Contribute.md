# How to Contribute

## Implementing tasks

1. Fork the repository(ies) involved in the task.
2. Create a branch named like `liquid-labs/liq-bounties.1`, where 'liuid-labs/liq-bounties' is the task's repo and '1' is the task number.
3. Implement the task. Refer to the section on [getting help](#getting-help) if you need any clarification or run into problems.
4. When ready, create a pull request for all the involved repositories.
   * Be sure and use the 'closes <the issues> in the pull request description.
   * If more than one repo/pull request is involved, then be sure and cross reference them. (This may involve going back and editing the descriptions after all the pull requests are created.)

## Getting help

Not al tasks are perfect. Sometimes you will find errors, omissions, and contradictions. If something doesn't make sense or is unclear, then please reach out. It's usually easier to make things clear than to clean up incorrect assumptions.

For any questions, clarification, or problems, please use the issue reply. Also, use the '@<github handle>' syntax to make callouts to the repo owner or task owner as appropriate.
